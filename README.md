8. You should see an image which shows the backend is running

## Installing Selenium for Testing
IMPORTANT - Testing programs for the website require Selenium. To install Selenium, do the following:
1. Open a new command terminal.
2. Navigate to the testing folder with "cd Testing".
1. Type in "npm install selenium-webdriver" into the command terminal.
2. In your "package.json" file add '"mocha": "10.8.2"' to the "dependencies."

## Running Tests
1. Open a new command terminal.
2. Navigate to the testing folder with 'cd Testing'
3. To run a test, enter 'node [insert file name here]'
4. IMPORTANT - When testing the stories and application pages run testAppSub.js or testStories.js first, then run the respective add/remove tests!
5. IMPORTANT - Before running testAppSub.js and testStories.js you MUST specify the position of the test submissions with the "expectedPosition" variable! Same goes for the accept, remove, and visible tests!
